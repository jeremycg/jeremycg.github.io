I have produced two major R packages that may be useful to others which are
currently available on GitHub. Instructions are available on GitHub.

### Plate Reading

[Package here](https://github.com/jeremycg/platereading)

A package for reading high throughput phenotype data from a bioanalyzer
machine, and output sensible fitted curves and summary statistics.

### Protracted Birth Death

[Package here](https://github.com/jeremycg/protractedbirthdeath)

A package for simulating the process of speciation under a protracted
birth death model.
