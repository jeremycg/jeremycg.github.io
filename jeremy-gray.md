I am broadly interested in the genetics of speciation and diversification, as well as experimental evolution, as well as biostatistics and bioinformatics.

I am also interested in data science, reproducible research tools, data analytics and R.

I am currently working in Asher Cutterâ€™s lab as a Post Doc on the genetics of speciation in Caenorhabditis.
