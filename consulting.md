In response to an increase in emails, I am now available for consulting work.

Yes, I am able to help fix your code.

Yes, I am able to write your code for you.

Yes, I am able to write you a shiny app.

Yes, I will charge you money for this.

I am also available for R and Python programming, web apps, statistics and machine learning work. I'm a trained software instructor and am happy to do private tutoring or instruction.

My rates are on a sliding scale - substantial discounts are available for work which will
 be released under an open source license, and for academics and students.

Please [email me](/Jeremy-Gray/) with a detailed description of the work,
and I will arrange a free consultation about your project.
